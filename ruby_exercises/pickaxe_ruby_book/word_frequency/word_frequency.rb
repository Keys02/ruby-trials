# Problem
# Our only problem is what to do when we encounter a word for the first time. If we try to increment the entry for that word, there wonâ€™t be one, so our program will fail. 
# If we encounter a word for the first time, we check whether the word exists as a ke in the hash before doing the increment
# =====================================================================================
